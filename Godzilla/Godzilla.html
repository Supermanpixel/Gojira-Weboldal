            <h2>Godzilla: The Origins</h2>
            <p>Godzilla is a fictional monster (kaiju) that originated in Japanese cinema. First appearing in the 1954
                film *Godzilla* (originally *Gojira*), the character has since become one of the most iconic figures in
                film history, known for his massive size, radioactive powers, and his role as both a destructive force
                and a protector of Earth.</p>
            <div>
                <img class="image-edit" src="godzilla1954.556721.jpg" alt="Fisrt appearance">
            </div>
            <h3>Creation and Symbolism</h3>
            <p>Godzilla was created by the Japanese film studio Toho, and his first appearance in 1954 was a response to
                the fears and anxieties Japan had about nuclear power. After the horrors of World War II, particularly
                the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan grappled with the traumatic effects of nuclear
                warfare. Godzilla's origin story reflects these fears, as the creature is depicted as a prehistoric
                reptilian creature awakened and mutated by the radioactive fallout from nuclear testing in the Pacific
                Ocean.</p>

            <p>The original film *Gojira* (1954), directed by Ishirō Honda, portrayed Godzilla as a terrifying force of
                nature, a creature of immense size and power, capable of leveling cities with its destructive breath and
                immense strength. This first film is a dark commentary on the dangers of nuclear weapons and the
                uncontrollable consequences of human experimentation with atomic energy.</p>

            <h3>Name: Gojira</h3>
            <p>"Godzilla" is the Americanized version of the Japanese name "Gojira" (ゴジラ), which is a combination of two
                words: "gorira" (ゴリラ), meaning "gorilla," and "kujira" (鯨), meaning "whale." This reflects the
                creature's hybrid characteristics—being both mighty like a gorilla and massive like a whale.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Evolution of Godzilla</h2>
            <p>Over the decades, Godzilla has evolved both in terms of appearance and character, transitioning from a
                destructive force to a more heroic figure, depending on the era and the tone of the films.</p>

            <h3>1. The Showa Era (1954–1975)</h3>
            <p>The original Godzilla was a symbol of nuclear devastation, but as the series continued, the character
                slowly began to shift. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Godzilla became less of a terrifying force and
                more of a protector of humanity. In films like *Son of Godzilla* (1967) and *Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla*
                (1974), Godzilla's role shifted to being more of a defender against other giant monsters, including some
                that were also the products of nuclear experimentation.</p>

            <h3>Key Films:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Godzilla (1954)</strong> – The first film, which set the tone of the character as a
                    villainous force of nature.</li>
                <li><strong>King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)</strong> – A famous crossover where Godzilla faces off against
                    King Kong, marking a shift towards more fantastical stories.</li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974)</strong> – One of the most iconic Showa films where
                    Godzilla fights a mechanical version of himself created by aliens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Heisei Era (1984–1995)</h3>
            <p>After a hiatus, Godzilla returned in *The Return of Godzilla* (1984), which reintroduced him as a more
                serious, menacing character, once again representing the destructive power of nuclear energy. The Heisei
                films are more consistent in their continuity and present Godzilla as a more complex character, facing
                off against new, powerful enemies, including the alien Mechagodzilla, the space monster Biollante, and
                the deadly kaiju, Destroyah.</p>

            <h3>Key Films:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Return of Godzilla (1984)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla vs. Biollante (1989)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla vs. Destroyah (1995)</strong> – Featuring Godzilla's "death" after battling the
                    creature Destroyah, a tragic end to the Heisei series.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. The Millennium Era (1999–2004)</h3>
            <p>The Millennium series took a different approach, with each film being largely standalone and ignoring the
                continuity of previous films, except for *Godzilla 2000: Millennium* (1999), which reestablished
                Godzilla as a fierce protector of the Earth against alien invaders and other kaiju.</p>

            <h3>Key Films:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Godzilla 2000: Millennium (1999)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla: Final Wars (2004)</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. The Legendary Era (2014–Present)</h3>
            <p>In the 2010s, a new series of films produced by Legendary Entertainment brought Godzilla to a global
                audience once again. This era includes both the American films and the subsequent Japanese releases.</p>

            <h3>Key Films:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Godzilla (2014)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)</strong></li>
            </ul>
